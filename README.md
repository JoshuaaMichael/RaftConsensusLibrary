# Project Overview
</br>
To use an existing proven consensus algorithm, the <a href="https://raft.github.io"/>Raft Consensus algorithm</a> (<a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">from the Paper</a>), to implement a fully featured library which would work as an almost drop-in style library to allow developers to write their projects with clustering/high availability as seamlessly as possible. This would allow multiple computers/servers to work together to ensure uptime of a service while smoothly handling node loss or broken network links. The project will be written as a C++ library to offer the broadest integrations possibilities, as those libraries can be referenced by almost any language. The library would be published as open source, under Apache2 license.
</br>
Although a working project of this would benefit more practical services, an easy demonstration of a working final product would be a simple console program. There would be multiple instances of the console program running, talking together, and it will demonstrate maintaining an activate replicated log against multiple node failures.
