# Project Overview  
>To use an existing proven consensus algorithm, the [Raft Consensus algorithm](https://raft.github.io) ([from the Paper](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf)), to implement a fully featured library which would work as an almost drop-in style library to allow developers to write their projects with clustering/high availability as seamlessly as possible. This would allow multiple computers/servers to work together to ensure uptime of a service while smoothly handling node loss or broken network links. The project will be written as a C# library to make it available to the widest possible audience. The library would be published as open source, under Apache2 license.  
>
>Although a working project of this would benefit more practical services, an easy demonstration of a working final product would be a simple console or gui program. There would be multiple instances of the console program running, talking together, and it will demonstrate maintaining an activate replicated log against multiple node failures.
